                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
                            I am a San Francisco Bay area native and wrapped up my PhD in physics</p>
                        <p>I am involved with the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/lunarsooners/index/Welcome.html"> Lunar
                                Sooners</a> as a founding member, and I often host the University of Oklahoma <a href="http://observatory.ou.edu/Welcome.html">
                                Public Star Parties</a>. The Lunar Sooners put on lectures, question and answer panels,
                            educational demonstrations, and star gazing events statewide. Please get in touch if you
                            would be interested in having us for an event, and if you're so graciously willing we
                            appreciate any donations toward the cause. The Ou star parties are held free of charge
                            every Wednesday of the school semester, weather permitting, at the Ou observatory on
                            campus. Take an evening off and come look through telescopes. We would love to show you
                            around the night sky!
                            <p>These days my research leverages white dwarf stars as probes of interesting astronomical
                                phenomena. In the past I've dabbled in studies of supernovae, photodissociation
                                regions, and top quark physics. In the future I very much look forward to working at
                                the intersect of data analysis and observing support or instrumentation in a team
                                environment. </p>

                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <p> I take spectroscopic measurements for the ELM survey on the KP 4m and Hale 5m
                                telescopes on roughly a biannual basis. With the exception of a few things we've
                                learned from those really elusive inverse beta-decay neutrino captures from SN1987A,
                                everything we know about the universe beyond the edge of the solar system has been
                                discovered by studying light that's traveled far and wide to reach us. However, one of
                                the last predictions yet to be verified from Einstien's theory of general relativity is
                                that of gravitational wave emission. To observe gravitational waves is to probe the
                                universe in a way that's never been done before which in turn will open up rich new
                                information both on galactic and cosmological scales.</p>

                            <p>In the ELM survey so far, my colleagues and I have discovered a few dozen short period
                                binary double white dwarf systems. As some of these systems show eclipses, we've been
                                able to measure the masses of both stars in the binary and their orbital periods. In
                                addition, we have precise coordinates for these objects so we can not only predict the
                                waveform of the gravitational waves and its strength in a precise fashion - we know
                                their point of origin on the sky. With this information, these sources can and will
                                serve to calibrate gravitational wave detectors such as eLISA.</p>
                            <p>As these sources slowly shed angular momentum to the ripples of space-time, the orbital
                                separation and period of these binary systems decreases. Some will merge on timescales
                                much less than the age of the universe, which suggests that similar systems may have
                                merged in the past. In this sense, the existence of these systems also serves as direct
                                evidence of progenitor channels to rapidly rotating white dwarfs, R Cor Bor stars, and
                                possibly supernovae. Untangling the oddities of the final stages of stellar evolution
                                can shed light on population synthesis studies as well as Ia supernovae, which of
                                course are important cosmological distance indicators that shed light on the nature of
                                dark energy. Why the universe is accelerating as opposed to decelerating by the pull of
                                gravity remains today one of the greatest open problems in physics and basic research!
                            </p>
                            <p> In other work I am using Keck data to take another look at the so called
                                initial-final mass relation. Astronomers are familiar with the initial mass relation -
                                a distribution of how many stars come to be as a function of their mass for a sample of
                                stars. In contrast, the initial-final mass relation describes how much mass a low or
                                intermediate mass star sheds from its formation until it reaches the end point of
                                stellar evolution as a white dwarf.

                                <p> To construct the initial-final mass relation, one must know the total lifetimes of
                                    many white dwarf stars over a range of masses. For this, we turn to well studied
                                    open and globular clusters. Of course, the final mass is the white dwarf mass. The
                                    initial mass then comes from subtracting the clusters age from the cooling age of
                                    the star, and with isochrone models the star's nuclear age is then converted to the
                                    star's initial mass. In my ongoing work with five open clusters, I will constrain
                                    the initial-final mass relation with state of the art model physics for a range of
                                    cluster ages, creating a systematically consistent study over a range of parameter
                                    space. </p>
                                <p> This relation has many uses in astronomy, but I'll highlight one of them here for
                                    you. One way to answer how old the Milky Way is, is to find the oldest star in our
                                    galaxy and figure out how long it has been in existence. Getting the ages of old
                                    low mass stars in an accurate fashion is difficult. Instead, one can look for the
                                    coolest white dwarfs. Lacking core fusion, white dwarfs simply cool in time after
                                    residual contraction from the AGB stage. Mathematical modeling of this physics
                                    yields how long the star has been a white dwarf. From the white dwarf's mass one
                                    can use the initial-final mass relation to get the ZAMS mass, and isochrones to get
                                    the stars nuclear burning lifetime. Adding together how long the star has been
                                    cooling as a white dwarf for with its nuclear burning lifetime gives the star's
                                    total age, and a minimum age of the galactic population that star belongs to. </p>
