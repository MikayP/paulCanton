            <p> I take spectroscopic measurements for the ELM survey on the KP 4m and Hale 5m
                telescopes on roughly a biannual basis. With the exception of a few things we've
                learned from those really elusive inverse beta-decay neutrino captures from SN1987A,
                everything we know about the universe beyond the edge of the solar system has been
                discovered by studying light that's traveled far and wide to reach us. However, one of
                the last predictions yet to be verified from Einstien's theory of general relativity is
                that of gravitational wave emission. To observe gravitational waves is to probe the
                universe in a way that's never been done before which in turn will open up rich new
                information both on galactic and cosmological scales...</p>


            <p>In the ELM survey so far, my colleagues and I have discovered a few dozen short period
                binary double white dwarf systems. As some of these systems show eclipses, we've been
                able to measure the masses of both stars in the binary and their orbital periods. In
                addition, we have precise coordinates for these objects so we can not only predict the
                waveform of the gravitational waves and its strength in a precise fashion - we know
                their point of origin on the sky. With this information, these sources can and will
                serve to calibrate gravitational wave detectors such as eLISA.</p>
            <p>As these sources slowly shed angular momentum to the ripples of space-time, the orbital
                separation and period of these binary systems decreases. Some will merge on timescales
                much less than the age of the universe, which suggests that similar systems may have
                merged in the past. In this sense, the existence of these systems also serves as direct
                evidence of progenitor channels to rapidly rotating white dwarfs, R Cor Bor stars, and
                possibly supernovae. Untangling the oddities of the final stages of stellar evolution
                can shed light on population synthesis studies as well as Ia supernovae, which of
                course are important cosmological distance indicators that shed light on the nature of
                dark energy. Why the universe is accelerating as opposed to decelerating by the pull of
                gravity remains today one of the greatest open problems in physics and basic research!
            </p>
            <p> In other work I am using Keck data to take another look at the so called
                initial-final mass relation. Astronomers are familiar with the initial mass relation -
                a distribution of how many stars come to be as a function of their mass for a sample of
                stars. In contrast, the initial-final mass relation describes how much mass a low or
                intermediate mass star sheds from its formation until it reaches the end point of
                stellar evolution as a white dwarf.</p>

            <p> To construct the initial-final mass relation, one must know the total lifetimes of
                many white dwarf stars over a range of masses. For this, we turn to well studied
                open and globular clusters. Of course, the final mass is the white dwarf mass. The
                initial mass then comes from subtracting the clusters age from the cooling age of
                the star, and with isochrone models the star's nuclear age is then converted to the
                star's initial mass. In my ongoing work with five open clusters, I will constrain
                the initial-final mass relation with state of the art model physics for a range of
                cluster ages, creating a systematically consistent study over a range of parameter
                space. </p>
            <p> This relation has many uses in astronomy, but I'll highlight one of them here for
                you. One way to answer how old the Milky Way is, is to find the oldest star in our
                galaxy and figure out how long it has been in existence. Getting the ages of old
                low mass stars in an accurate fashion is difficult. Instead, one can look for the
                coolest white dwarfs. Lacking core fusion, white dwarfs simply cool in time after
                residual contraction from the AGB stage. Mathematical modeling of this physics
                yields how long the star has been a white dwarf. From the white dwarf's mass one
                can use the initial-final mass relation to get the ZAMS mass, and isochrones to get
                the stars nuclear burning lifetime. Adding together how long the star has been
                cooling as a white dwarf for with its nuclear burning lifetime gives the star's
                total age, and a minimum age of the galactic population that star belongs to. </p>
